# Random-Name-Generator
Simple Javascript to display random name from a list. This can be used to find a random number from a range (min & max) and can be displayed randomly.
<br />
I have used `innerHTML` to replace the text inside the <span> class with the randomly generated value.<br />
I often use console.log to check if the JavaScript is working properly and it can be tweaked by changing the min & max value.
## Usage

```javascript
var names = ['...',
...]; //include names here
console.log(winner(minvalue, maxvalue)); //for debugging
```
